**Assignment**: Focusing on the texts we’ve read so far, please argue for/against an answer to *one* of the following questions:

1. What does it mean to love?
2. Is Socrates a good lover?
3. Love—utopic or apocalyptic?
4. Is liberation erotic?
5. t4t?

The best papers will

- Focus on a single aspect of an answer that the student is genuinely interested in;
- Clearly state and vigorously defend an [arguable thesis](https://resources.dingherself.com/writing/thesis-statement.html);
- be accessible to a typical undergraduate student who has not taken our class;
- have an opinion and speak in the [student’s own voice](https://resources.dingherself.com/writing/objection-reply-style.html); and
- go beyond our discussions in a way insightful to the rest of the class.
