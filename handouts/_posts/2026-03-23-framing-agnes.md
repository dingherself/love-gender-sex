*Due*: Wednesday, March 25, by the beginning of class, to CourseWorks > Assignments\
*Format*: Short video recording of your post-movie discussion, along with a brief note describing when/where your screening took place and who participated in it

Please host a screening of [*Framing Agnes*](https://www.kanopy.com/en/barnard/video/12944145) (streamable from *Kanopy* through the library) with at least two classmates, friends, and/or family members; I’ll make a discussion thread for those looking to invite others.

Afterwards, please discuss the following question: *The question of frames is front and center in the documentary: Which trans stories get framed in what ways and by whom? And if trans people ever get to do that framing rather than have it imposed onto trans stories, what would these stories be? Toward the end, Professor Jules Gill-Peterson asks “Can we move the frame? Can we do things differently?” and confesses that she doesn’t know. What do you think?*
