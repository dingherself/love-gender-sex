## Today

- The flute-girl’s [“flutes”](https://youtube.com/shorts/qj4Pdfistk0?si=aaaXyWPDNqq69bD_) [[play in the background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psW7xQHYVdY&list=PLgYpTymV9Rjyaz87IOX9WkKBfaWQdhHmQ&index=2)]
- A quick reminder about grades: Please ignore “percentage” + we value improvement
- Warm-up activity: Erotic love vs. political love
- Ding’s history story hour (interjections welcome!): Second-wave feminism, lavender menace, WCLC, and time permitting, Topside

## Warm-up activity

1. Marilyn Frye’s question: Have you ever been called lesbian/dyke/gay/fag or been accused of being lesbian/gay?
2. In a world that socializes us to internalize misogyny, is it at all possible to love women? If so, how come; if not, what now?

## The women’s liberation movement

[A chronology in progress](https://github.com/dingherself/phil-324/blob/main/handouts/07-chronology.md)

- 1967: National Conference for New Politics incident => Westside group in Chicago & New York Radical Women (NYRW)
- 1968: more local groups emerged across the U.S.; NYRW *Notes from the First Year* & [“No More Miss America” protest](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1doHmsI4EoIEsu1XNSBzhwFXz9iYU4cxCkZnHM-YhmgE/edit?usp=sharing) in Atlantic City
- 1969: Stonewall riots
- 1970: “Lavender menace” incident & Radicalesbian takeover

### Some characteristically lesbian feminist critiques

- Firestone: Patriarchy is a rigged role-playing game: Sex roles include not just *woman* and *man* but also *wife*, *cook*, *caretaker of my children*, *housekeeper*, etc.
- Shelly: Straight sex roles are just as artificial/natural as queer sex roles.
  - Koedt: Myth of the vaginal orgasm.

- Radicalesbians: Heterosexual sex roles are “male-identified”—they require women to identify with men and serve men’s interests. 
- Firestone interpreting Beauvoir: But if love requires equality, then genuine heterosexual love is socially impossible. Potential responses:
  1. The man relinquishes masculine sex roles (no longer heterosexual).
  2. The woman plays the traditional heterosexual dating game to secure a man (no longer genuine love).
  3. The woman refuses to participate in heterosexual dating (no longer heterosexual).
- Frye: Refusing to play one’s assigned heterosexual roles/being feminist => being nonheterosexual if not lesbian.
- Radicalesbians: Lesbian = “woman-identified woman.”
  - Reappropriates “lesbians are not [real] women.”
  - Lesbians are not male-/patriarchy-identified women: Wholesale rejection of men in one’s life, refusal to be objectified, to be “fucked by men.”
  - Lesbians love women *politically* and let their “energies . . . flow toward our sisters, not backward toward our oppressors.”
  - “Women’s liberation is a lesbian plot.”

*Political lesbianism*: Being lesbian is a deliberate feminist political commitment; “feminism is the theory, lesbianism is the practice.”

- Would there be lesbians “after the revolution”? Millet: We would all be nonbinary and bisexual.
- Public litigation of Millet’s own sexuality.
- Frye: Rejecting heterosexuality ≠ being lesbian.

*Lesbian separatism*: Women “cut ties” from men and male-identified relationships, institutions, and cultures.

- 1973 West Coast Lesbian Conference & SF Gutter Dykes & Beth Elliott
- Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival & “womyn-born womyn” & Camp Trans
- Olivia Records & Sandy Stone

## The Brooklyn trans lit scene of the early 10s

A “renaissance” of trans stories written by trans authors for a trans audience [Amelie, Sophia, Sitian]

- Attempt to break out of the “trans memoir” genre.
- Attempt to challenge cis-written trans characters and narratives.

Epicenter: Topside Press in Brooklyn

- No mainstream publisher would publish t4t lit. 
- *The Collection: Short Fiction from the Transgender Vanguard* (2012)
- *Is There a Transgender Text in This Class?* (2013), Topside’s Bechdel test:
  - Does the book include more than one trans character?
  - Do they know each other?
  - Do they talk to each other about something besides a transition-related medical procedure?
- Imogen Binnie’s *Nevada* (2013)
- Became a gatekeeper of trans lit
- Whiteness problem [Solomon], failure to publish trans writers of color
- 2016 Trans Women’s Writing Workshop at Brooklyn College
  - “[T]he workshop had mostly white attendees, did not adequately accommodate attendees with disabilities, and separated the two group subdivisions based on decisions about class and prestige” (Amy Marvin, “Short-Circuited Trans Care, t4t, and Trans Scenes,” p. 20).

Torrey Peters’ novella project

- DIY self-publishing movement, bypassing Topside and commercial publishers.
- *Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones* (2016): Dystopian sci-fi.
- *The Masker* (2016): Gender horror.
- *Glamour Boutique* (2017): Grown into the long-form *Detransition, Baby* (2021).

*Infect* and *Masker* have recently been republished by Penguin Random House as part of the collection *Stag Dance* (2025).

Is there any distance between trans literature and literature of trans stories? Reductive/flattening? [Sierra]
