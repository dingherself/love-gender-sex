## Tips

- Instead of writing “up” to me as the professor, try addressing your shorties to your classmates (yes, you can—and *should*—respond to each other and reference class discussions!).
- If you are new to philosophy, the best way to think of your task is “I’m going to tell the class about this one thing the reading is so wrong about.”
- Try a [three-part structure](https://resources.dingherself.com/writing/objection-reply-style.html): Exposition ⇒ Objection ⇒ Reply.
- Focus—and *focus*—on an idea or an argument you feel strongly about, that gets you going, that fascinates you, upsets you, confuses you, …

## Tweaks

- We will institute a soft limit of 6 shorties: If you are interested in materials, come talk to us in office hours please! If you’d like to improve, you must still come to office hours for feedback first.
- The shorties are now graded out of “0”—Canvas requires us to put in a number, unfortunately.
- We expect students to “own up to” what they write in shorties. If you say something we find *really* interesting or puzzling, we will invite you to discuss and defend (not merely talk about) it in class.

## Common problems

1. **Speak in your own voice**—don’t let another philosopher speak for you. The shorty is not a book report, nor does it require forced neutrality; we are interested in *your* critical discussion.
2. **Don’t *just* ask questions**—we want to see you work out your own answer, even if it’s not fully satisfying to you.
3. **Please show your work**—where are you getting this from? Interpretations are not free; you have to pay with textual evidence.
4. **Don’t attack a strawman**—pick a real fight and let the poor strawman live.
5. **Pick your battles**—go deep, not broad. “Contain philosophical problems one at a time.”
6. **Get to the point**—we are ultimately so much more interested in what *you* think!
7. **Respect the word limit**—we will stop reading if it’s too long.
8. **We’ve heard this already**—if other students are discussing an idea already, don’t reinvent the wheel. Be part of the conversation.
