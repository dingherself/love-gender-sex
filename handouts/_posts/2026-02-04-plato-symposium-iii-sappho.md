## Alcibiades

Aristophanes has an objection (he got singled out for critique in Socrates’/Diotima’s speech), but we never get to hear what he has to say because Alcibiades shows up completely “plastered” (212e).

- Reappearance of the flute-girl
- Whole drama of him sitting down

Alcibiades is obviously deeply in love with Socrates.

- But he also accuses Socrates of stealing “the most handsome man in the room” (213c), of not telling the truth (214d), of “trap[ping]” him (216a), of “bit[ing] me in my most sensitive part—I mean my heart” (218a), of “humiliat[ing]” him (219d), …
  - Indeed, even though Alcibiades says he “shall never forgive” Socrates, he still can’t help but adore Socrates’ “magnificent head” (213e).
  - Does Alcibiades’s love for Socrates desire the good? Is it a more bodily or intellectual kind of love? How does this trouble the Ascent of Love?
- Subversion of pederasty norms: The *erômenos* is meant to be passively *desired as an object of love*, and he is not supposed to actively pursue sexual pleasure with the *erastês*.
- Is Socrates a good lover? Is philosophy/reason compatible with love?

## The ending

- As is custom, the men gradually drift off to sleep/go home.
- The last remaining four are Agathon, Aristophanes, Socrates, and Aristodemus (223c).
  - We are reminded throughout the text that nobody has ever seen Socrates drunk.
  - Socrates persuades Agathon and Aristophanes that a good tragic poet is also a comic poet (223d).
  - In the morning, Socrates goes directly to the Lyceum (gym that’s also a significant social location for pederasty).

## Loose threads

- Is the *Symposium* a comedy? a tragedy? a comic tragedy?
- Why does the story of the *Symposium* need to be told 12 years ago through a game of telephone?
  - The failure of the Sicilian Expedition immediately after the symposium.
  - The recent assassination of Alcibiades just before Glaucon and friend’s conversation.

## Sappho

- Entry in Witting & Zerg’s [*Lesbian Peoples: Material for a Dictionary*](https://archive.org/details/lesbianpeoplesma00witt).
  - Both “sapphic” and “lesbian” allude to Sappho.

- Not generally recognized as a lesbian until quite recently.
  - Patriarchy took my girl: Fr. 31.
  - Too gay to function: Fr. 94.
  - Women are so breathtaking: Fr. 122.
- Not generally recognized as a philosopher.
  - In addition to love/*eros* (a full-body experience vs. a mere feeling), Sappho reflects on desire, longing (“yearn”), memory, change, sorrow, family, [women’s] beauty …
    - “Brothers Song”: Rediscovered in 2014.
  - But she loves wisdom in an affective (cf. rational—but be careful about drawing a sharp line) way: A focus on the sensual, the bodily, the erotic.
  - Who gets to decide who is a philosopher? What counts as philosophical? What’s at stake?
- “I say someone in another time will remember us” (fr. 147).
