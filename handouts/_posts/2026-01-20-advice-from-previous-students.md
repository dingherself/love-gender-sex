It can be daunting to take your first philosophy class! Because there is often a steep learning curve, I want to help you adjust to thinking like a philosopher as smoothly as possible.

When I taught this class last spring at the University of Arizona, I gave students an opportunity to leave an anonymous note to future students offering their advice. Below is a selection of what they wrote.

## Generally

- “While this class may seem a little silly at first, it truly is mind-opening if you follow the readings and lectures. I have learned a lot about myself and others from this class.”
- “I would say ask questions. Come with an open minded. Get ready to think about things in ways you didn’t think about before. Watch the movies, documentaries. See and hear other people’s perspectives. Take time to think to yourself too, time to reflect on the topics and maybe even see how some or all of them apply to you.”
- “Be more open-minded. Kind of basic but it’s true. Going into this class I wasn’t sure what to expect, but as we discussed and I was able to listen and understand other opinions and understanding it helped me realize how to open my mind to the world.”
- “No matter how quiet/shy you are, find a friend during the first week that you can text if you miss class [or] don’t understand a reading.”
- “Tell [future students] not to be afraid to explore new things.”
- “Some advice I would give to future students is be open-minded and allow yourself to be uncomfortable talking about new perspectives, even if you don’t align with them yourself.”

## Readings

- “Actually read the content. Please! This course had an insanely good reading list and should be taken seriously!”
- “My advice would be to take time with the material and form an opinion. It makes the class more interactive.”
- “READ THE MATERIAL. I skipped 1 or 2 and was so lost the next day. I spent so much more time making up progress than if I had just read.”
- “Read all the readings and really engage with the material so that you get more out of the course.”
- “Make sure to do the readings! The readings are basically one of the most important things of this class. They’re the foundation for everything.”

## Classes

- “I think asking questions or getting clarification in class is the best way to approach a beginner’s philosophy class like this. There is a lot of ideas. You may think you understand, but then end up meaning something completely different.”
- “Also participate! The class is so much more fun when people participate.”
- “Talk your way through these concepts! Don’t assume you know it backwards and forwards.”
- “I would advise [future students] to always pay close attention to the class discussion. We can learn a lot from our peers as well as different points of view.”
- “For future students, converse with your classmates, stay attentive to details, and do your own research in your free time. It will all benefit you.”
- “Come to class! As easy as it is to miss class time, because the course is set up in such a way that is possible to learn the material on your own, you will have such a deeper understanding of the material . . . if you listen to the lectures. Connections from each subject arrive more easily if they’re explained to you and guided.”
- “No matter what the class is, show up.”

## Assignments

- “Please take this class with an open mind and be ready to share your thoughts. Don’t be afraid to really write what you think.”
