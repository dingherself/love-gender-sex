## Today

- Reading Beauvoir as a philosopher [20 min]
- Thinking through the argument on her own terms
- Questions on the first response paper [save 10 min]

## The Question<sup>®</sup>: What is a woman?

Two seemingly contradictory claims: p. 

- If womanhood is in the uterus, how can it be “endangered”?

So maybe there are no women? p. 

- The “American” view: We are all just human beings.
- Beauvoir: Denying reality won’t help liberate women.

Why do we worry so much more about defining womanhood than manhood? pp. –

- Defining what it is to be a man is easy—“the man represents both the positive and the neuter.”
- Womanhood is the lack thereof—the “Other.”
- Womanhood is not only a *social* becoming but an *unequal* one.

How did women’s subordination to men come about? pp. –

- Not numerical disadvantage.
- “it did not *happen*”
- Did it *not* happen?
- Still, what gave men the advantage?

## Biological data

Sex categories are organized around sexuality.

- But reproduction alone does not require a binary system of sex categorization.

Attempts to justify social difference/equality from biological difference/equality are misguided.

- Brain size example: pp.  ff
- What matters is the *meaning* that we ascribe to biology.
- Womanhood is a response to a situation.

## History

Women are stuck with biological reproduction.

- Men get to create values and meanings.
- A very surprising answer from Beuavior?
